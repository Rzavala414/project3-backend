After thirty-plus years of keeping score of Cribbage matches on notepads and excel spreadsheets, our fearless leader Dan Grigg decided enough was enough. He conceptualized a better way to score of cribbage matches and track statistics that was user friendly and made it relevant for the current generation. Our group created a mobile-first MERN app that accompanies offline game-play of cribbage that dynamically updates scores and adds them to a profile page and Global LeaderBoard.

### How to Run Our App
Please, use our posted Heroku link to use the aplication. Once the app is running please click the "Get Started" button to begin the experience.
Once inside the application it will require you to sign up fro a new account, so please enter a new one along with an email so team CribSmack may keep you updated on any news. Once logged in you will be on our app's "/Dashboard." This is the main hub of how our whole entire application functions.
At the bottom of the screen you can navigate your way through our application, the icons are your guide. The person icon is the icon that will navigate you to your overall statistics. Second, the play button icon is how to grab a new score card to keep track of your game statistics and uploard it to our database.
Third, the trophy icon is a way for you to view the current global leaderboard. Lastly, the gavel icon is your route to see the rules and regulations of Cribbage.
